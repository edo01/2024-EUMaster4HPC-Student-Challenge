# output
# the first column is the number of rows in the matrix
# the second column is the number of MPI processes
# the third column is the number of threads
# the fourth column is the time to generate the matrix
# the fifth column is the average time for one iteration

# This test is trying to analyze the performance of the MPI+OMP solver
# under a load of massive data. Each node allocates 466 GB of memory to
# and computes just some iterations of the CG algorithm.

# 64 MPI processes and 128 threads per process
# SIZE of the matrix: 29,125 TB
