# The first column is the size of the matrix
# The second column is the number of MPI processes / devices
# The third column is the number of OpenMP threads
# The fourth column is the time to read the matrix or generate the matrix in seconds
# The fifth column is the average time to perform the GEMV operation in seconds
# The sixth column is the average time to perform a single iteration of the CG algorithm in seconds
# The seventh column is the number of iterations of the CG algorithm
# The eighth column is the error of the CG algorithm
# The ninth column is the time to perform the entire CG algorithm in seconds

# This test is trying to analyze the performance of the MPI+CUDA solver
# under a load of massive data. Each device allocates 36 GB of memory 
# and computes just some iterations of the CG algorithm.

# 64 devices are used to solve a 560000x560000 matrix
